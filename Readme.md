Neos Media Ui
-------------

This package contains the new interface to manage media in Neos CMS.

During the development the package will be in the Flowpack namespace and will
later replace `neos/media-browser`. Having two modules allows us currently to install
them both and be able to test them without losing features.

If you want to use Neos, please have a look at the [Neos documentation](http://neos.readthedocs.org/en/stable/).
